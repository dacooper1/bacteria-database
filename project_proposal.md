# Project Proposal

Use this template to help get you started right away! Once the proposal is complete, please let your mentor know that this is ready to be reviewed.

## Get Started

|            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Fill in |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Tech Stack | What tech stack will you use for your final project? It is recommended to use the following technologies in this project: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Depending on your idea, you might end up using WTForms and other technologies discussed in the course. |

    - Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

| Type | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else? - This will be a website

| Goal | What goal will your project be designed to achieve? - The goal will be to get characterists of different bacterial strains and identify unknown bacteria by comparing in lab data to the data on the wesbite.

| Users | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

- This is made for students primarily studing microbioligy, biology or biochemistry looking to get more information about different bacteria species.

| Data | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. - I plan to use the BacDive APi to get information of differnt bacteria species and their characteristics.

# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later. Some common tasks might include:

- Determining the database schema
- Sourcing your data
- Determining user flow(s)
- Setting up the backend and database
- Setting up the frontend
- What functionality will your app include?
  - User login and sign up
  - Uploading a user profile picture

Here are a few examples to get you started with. During the proposal stage, you just need to create the tasks. Description and details can be edited at a later time. In addition, more tasks can be added in at a later time.

| Task Name | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |

Design Database schema - Determine the models and database schema required for your project. (Documentation - Easy)

Source Your Data - Determine where your data will come from. You may choose to use an existing API or create your own.(Documentation - Easy)

User Flows - Determine user flow(s) - think about what you want a user’s experience to be like as they navigate your site.(Documentation - Easy)

Set up backend and database - Configure the environmental variables on your framework of choice for development and set up database.(back end - medium )

Set up frontend example - et up frontend framework of choice and link it to the backend with a simple API call for example.(front end - medium)

User Authentication - ability to authenticate (login and sign up) as a user (Full stack - medium)

Set up Models - Using models.py and corresponding database (backend - easy)

Set up Forms - Using WTForms (full stack - easy)

Add Favourites - Feature to favourite different bacteria detail pages for easy access (full stack - medium)

Search for Bacteria - Ability to search for bacteria with search bar (full stack - medium)

Unknown Bacteria Filtering - When user conduct lab tests on unknown bacteria, they can input the results of the test and the website will narrow down which species of bacteria they are working with as results are added. User will be left with a list of possible bacteria strains. (full stack - hard - stretch goal)

## Labeling

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress. Here’s an [example](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues) of a list of issues that have labels associated.

| Label Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Difficulty | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficultlies will be essential.                                                                                                                               | Easy, Medium, Hard           |
| Type       | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack |

| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.
