# Project Proposal

## Tech Stack

- Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Type

- Web Application

## Goal

- The goal will be to get characterists of different bacterial strains to use for identification and/or educational purposes.

## Users

- This was made for students primarily studying microbiology, biology or biochemistry looking to get more information about different bacteria species.

## Data

- I plan to use the BacDive APi to get information of differnt bacteria species and their characteristics.

## Breaking down your project

_Design Database schema_ - Determine the models and database schema required for your project. (Documentation - Easy)

_Source Your Data_ - Determine where your data will come from. You may choose to use an existing API or create your own.(Documentation - Easy)

_User Flows_ - Determine user flow(s) - think about what you want a userâ€™s experience to be like as they navigate your site.(Documentation - Easy)

_Set up backend and database_ - Configure the environmental variables on your framework of choice for development and set up database.(back end - medium )

_Set up frontend example_ - Set up frontend framework of choice and link it to the backend with a simple API call for example.(front end - medium)

_User Authentication_ - Ability to authenticate (login and sign up) as a user (Full stack - medium)

_Set up Models_ - Using models.py and corresponding database (backend - easy)

_Set up Forms_ - Using WTForms (full stack - easy)

_Add Favourites_ - Feature to favourite different bacteria detail pages for easy access (full stack - medium)

_Search for Bacteria_ - Ability to search for bacteria with search bar (full stack - medium)

_Unknown Bacteria Filtering_ - When user conduct lab tests on unknown bacteria, they can input the results of the test and the application will narrow down which species of bacteria they are working with as results are added. User will be left with a list of possible bacteria strains. (full stack - hard - stretch goal)
