# Project Ideas

## Microbial Identification/Catalog:

- A website that assists users in identifying microorganisms based on their characteristics.
- Users can input information such as colony morphology, Gram stain results, and other relevant features, and the app can suggest possible microbial species.
- This will also have a catalog of several microorganisms that will show their characteristics
- Identification feature where you select certain characteristics that will filter through the catalog to provide relevant microorganisms
- Uses the NCBI Entrex API
- My background is in Biochemistry so this is my number one choice

## Movie/Show Catalog:

- Creates a visual catalog of movies/shows you have watched
- Feature to add ratings, comments etc
- Future features:
  - Be able to add friends and see their profile
  - Recommend similar movies/shows to user
  - Let the user recommend shows/movies to friends

## Resume Scanner

- Lets users upload their resume (maybe just copy and paste the text for now) and compares it to the job posting
- Return report with:
  - Pros and cons from a recruiters perspective
  - Missing key words
  - Etc
